# on-chain-ui
Build and compose UI components on-chain.

This tool will allow you to build UI components (and frontends) on-chain. These "decentralized" frontends will be trustlessly served from Ethereum/L2s. 

It will also allow you to easily compose/remix existing frontends so that you can quickly build your frontend on top of the work of others. 

On-chain UI has a few game-changing properties compared to traditional way of creating frontends for smart contracts:
* No need to worry about interacting with the chain using RPCs since the frontend itself is on-chain
* No need to set up wallet connections
* No need to set up an indexer
* No need to worry about hosting the frontend
    

## How do I contribute?

The on-chain UI idea is still in the early stages and could use lots of feedback from community to drive it in the right directions.

If you want to contribute, there are a few options:
* Follow the [docs](https://github.com/ilamanov/on-chain-ui/blob/main/docs.md) to build a frontend for your favorite contract and improve the docs if anything is not clear.
* Build interesting frontends/use cases. In the docs, I have a [list of ideas](https://github.com/ilamanov/on-chain-ui/blob/main/frontends-to-build.md). Feel free to add your ideas to the list.
* Write blog posts.
