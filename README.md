# on-chain-ui
Build and compose UI components on-chain

This tool will allow people to build frontends (UI components) on-chain. These "decentralized" frontends will be trustlessly served from Ethereum/L2s. 

It will also allow to easily compose/remix existing frontends so that people can quickly build their frontends on top of the work of others. 

On-chain UI has a few game-changing properties compared to traditional way of creating frontends for smart contracts:
* No need to worry about interacting with the chain using RPCs since the frontend itself is on-chain.
* No need to set up wallet connections
* No need to set up an indexer
* No need to worry about hosting the frontend
