# Frontends to build

Here are a few ideas for fun frontends to build. Feel free to work on any one of them. After you're done, please remove your entry from this list and add it to [examples](examples.md) section instead.

Also, feel free to add your own ideas to this list.

- Generic frontend for **WETH** and other **ERC-20 tokens**. (Working on it - [@ilamanov](https://github.com/ilamanov))
- An alternative frontend for **friend.tech**. The core contract of friend.tech is only ~100 lines of code so it shouldn't be too hard to implement.
- A frontend for **Uniswap**. Right now it would be especially timely given a real need to have access to decentralized frontends.
- **ENS**. Registration process and dashboard to monitor/search for available ENS names.
- **A widget for ENS info** such as ENS name/avatar/social links/etc. Would be very useful to have an embeddable widget that displays all this information in a pretty format. (h/t [@imtimaj](https://twitter.com/imtimaj))
- Generic frontend for **NFTs (ERC-721 tokens)**. A "generalized mint button" would be fun to implement.
- A "social network" where people can upload their profiles on-chain - host their **homepages on-chain**. (h/t [@parseb](https://twitter.com/parseb/status/1719349714053652607))
- Crypto tipping app (inpired by [@0xKofi](https://x.com/0xKofi/status/1699798632504103286))
